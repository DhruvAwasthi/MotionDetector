# InfraRed (IR) Motion Detector built using Arduino Board
This is a Motion Dectector device which display the count,the object has crossed it on an interfaced display.

This devices makes use of an ARDUINO UNO, a IR Sensor and a 16X2 LCD Display.
To make sure the LCD is connected properly, you can refer to this article:

To interface IR Sensor with Arduino, make sure:

-> Connect the negative wire on the IR sensor to GND on the Arduino.

-> Connect the middle of the IR sensor which is the VCC to 5V on the Arduino.

-> Connect the signal pin on the IR sensor to pin A0 on the Arduino.

After making all the connections you can expect it to work properly, as it is working in the video!

Thank you :)
